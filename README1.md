Bright Blitz; Powerful DoS tool written in Python

Just one thing to say, this is my first ever open source porject and I'm happy anyway.

Have neighbors who blast you with music everyday annoying you, or your just are an asshole who wants to annoy their neighbors, or maybe your just a programmer curious and wanna do something new? The Bright Blitz tool as got you covered.

There are 2 versions given for this project first one is less impressive and the second one is better if you want to cause some real nefarious, amazingly working attacks. 

Both of these scripts ask for ip and port and you might be curious how can you figure out an ip's port? Well in my perosnal opinion the best way to do it is with a free tool named "Angry IP Scanner" which is available in Windows, Linux and even Mac. But with mac you mught have some issues with downloading, that's just what happened to me. For the fake ips they only help a bit if you want the best possible protection for your *real ip being found I suggest using a VPN or a proxy server.

If anyone is curious how the script works I'm too lazy to explain everything but to keep it in simple words, the script sends a lot of network traffic to a target IP address using different protocols. It can adjust its settings dynamically and handles errors by logging them. Attack methods consist of UDP, TCP & ICMP.

Side note before my exit: Don't question what the hell I was doing with the ascii art for this project. 

Bye.
